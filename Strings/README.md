Strings Roatation Of Each Other

You are given two strings s1 and s2, of equal lengths. The task is to check if s2 is a rotated version of the string s1. 
Note: A string is a rotation of another if it can be formed by moving characters from the start to the end (or vice versa) without rearranging them.

Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "cdab"
Output: true
Explanation: After 2 right rotations, s1 becomes "cdab", which is equal to s2.
